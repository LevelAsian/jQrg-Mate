Club Mate Copycat
Step 1: Ingredients
Ingredients
For 1l of "Club Mate Copycat" you'll need the following:

- Yerba Mate (3 tbs, ~10g)
- hot water (2c, ~500ml)
- brown sugar (3tbs, ~35g)
- citric acid (1/2tsp, ~2g)
- carbonated water (~500ml) (preferably refridgerated)
Equipment
- Something that boils water
- Something that holds water
- Tea filter
Step 2: Mix
Fill the yerba mate into tea filter, add hot water and let it sit for at least 7min.
Then remove the tea filter, add the sugar, the citric acid, and stir until dissolved.
At this point, the "mate base" may get a little cloudy and will taste way too sweet and sour at the same time.
Don't worry about that, as it will get fixed in the next step.
Step 3: Drink!
Let the "mate base" cool down (add ice cubes if you're impatient) and put it in the fridge for some minutes.
Shortly before drinking, combine carbonated water and the cold "mate base" in a 1:1 ratio. This makes sure you always have a fizzy drink.
